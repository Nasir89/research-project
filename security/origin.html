    <main>
        <h2>SAME ORIGIN</h2>

        <h3>What is same origin?</h3>
       <hr> <p>When you request a HTTPS connection to a webpage, the website will initially send its SSL certificate to your browser.
            This certificate contains the public key needed to begin the secure session. Based on this initial exchange,
            your browser and the website then initiate the 'SSL handshake'. The SSL handshake involves the generation of
            shared secrets to establish a uniquely secure connection between yourself and the website.</p>

        <h3>why is same origin Important?</h3>
       <hr> <p> HTTPS helps prevent intruders from interfering with communications between your websites and users' browsers. By
            intruders, we mean attackers with malicious intentions and legitimate, but meddlesome companies, such as ISPs
            or hotels that feature page ads. Intruders exploit unprotected communications to trick users into providing confidential
            information or installing malicious software, or to place their own ads on your resources. For example, some
            third parties insert ads on websites that potentially have the ability to spoil the user experience and create
            security vulnerabilities. Intruders exploit all the unprotected resources that circulate between your websites
            and users. Images, cookies, scripts, HTML ... all can be exploited. Intrusions can occur anywhere on the network,
            such as a user's machine, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and a compromised ISP, to name a few.</p>

        <h3>How Does same origin Work?</h3>
        <hr><p>HTTPS pages typically use one of two secure protocols to encrypt communications - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS
            (Transport Layer Security). Both the TLS and SSL protocols use what is known as an 'asymmetric' Public Key Infrastructure
            (PKI) system. An asymmetric system uses two 'keys' to encrypt communications, a 'public' key and a 'private'
            key. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and vice-versa. As the names
            suggest, the 'private' key should be kept strictly protected and should only be accessible the owner of the private
            key. In the case of a website, the private key remains securely ensconced on the web server. Conversely, the
            public key is intended to be distributed to anybody and everybody that needs to be able to decrypt information
            that was encrypted with the private key.</p>
