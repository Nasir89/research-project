        <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">A cookie is a piece of information in the form of a very small text file that is placed on an internet user's hard
            drive. It is generated by a web page server, which is basically the computer that operates a web site. The information
            the cookie contains is set by the server and it can be used by that server whenever the user visits the site.
            A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which tell a web site when the user has
            returned, they can be used to store all sorts of information, like preferences, browser type, location, etc.
            and this information can be used to better users experience Typically, they contain two pieces of information:
            a site name and unique user ID.</p>
        <img src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/web-cookies-diagram.jpg?x92042">

        <p class="textBody"> To be technical, the browser is the program that mediates cookie control between the computer and the website. These
            cookies used by a website to present different types of content depending on who is visiting that website. Cookies
            can expire after a given time period (usually determined by the website issuing the cookie), but if necessary,
            they can be manually deleted.</p>
        <h3>What does a cookie look like?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody"> Below is the content of a typical cookie. This one is from the Hotmail service and has the filename jss@hotmail.msn.txt
            (.txt is the standard filename extension for text files):</p>
        <p class="quote"> HMP1 1 hotmail.msn.com/ 0 1715191808 <br> 32107852 1236821008 29449527 * </p>
        <p class="textBody"> The codes will only make sense to Microsoft's MSN Hotmail servers. </p>
        <h3>a bit of History </h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">
            Cookies for the internet were originally developed in 1995 by the Netscape Communications Corporation. The word 'cookie'
            comes from 'magic cookie,' a term in programming languages for a piece of information shared between co-operating
            pieces of software. The choice of the word cookie appears to come from the American tradition of giving and sharing
            edible cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>How do Cookies work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">When you visit a site that uses cookies for the first time, a cookie is downloaded onto your PC. The next time you
            visit that site, your PC checks to see if it has a cookie that is relevant (that is, one containing the site
            name) and sends the information contained in that cookie back to the site. The site then ‚Äôknows‚Äô that you have
            been there before, and in some cases, tailors what pops up on screen to take account of that fact. For instance,
            it can be helpful to vary content according to whether this is your first ever visit to a site ‚Äì or your 71st.
            <br> Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be
            very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping cart or to remember the user's preferences
            or registration details for a future visit. Web sites use cookies mainly because they save time and make the
            browsing experience more efficient and enjoyable. Web sites often use cookies for the purposes of collecting
            demographic information about their users. Cookies enable web sites to monitor their users' web surfing habits
            and profile them for marketing purposes (for example, to find out which products or services they are interested
            in and send them targeted advertisements).
        </p>
        <h3>Are cookies dangerous?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">
        No. Cookies are small pieces of text. They are not computer programs, and they can't be executed as code. 
        Also, they cannot be used to disseminate viruses, and modern versions of browsers allow users to set their own limitations to the number of cookies saved on their hard drives.
        <br>
        So why the paranoia? The answer probably depends on how you feel about organisations 
        ‚Äì both big business and government ‚Äì storing information about you. 
        There is nothing especially secret or exceptional about the information gathered by cookies, 
        but you may just dislike the idea of your name being added to marketing lists, or your information being used 
        to target you for special offers. That is your right, just as others are entitled to go along with the process.
        <br>
        When cookies first started to appear, there was controversy. Some people regarded them as inherently sneaky 
        - your PC was being used (without warning) to store personal information about you,
         which could then be used to build a picture of your browsing habits.
        <br>
        Cookies are stored on the computer's hard drive. They cannot access the hard drive - 
        so a cookie can't read other information saved on the hard drive, or get a user's e-mail address etc. 
        They only contain and transfer to the server as much information as the users themselves have disclosed to a certain web site.
        <br>
        A server cannot set a cookie for a domain that it is not a member of. In spite of this, users quite often find 
        in their computer files cookies from web sites that they have never visited. These cookies are usually set by companies 
        that sell internet advertising on behalf of other web sites. Therefore it may be possible that users' information 
        is passed to third party web sites without the users' knowledge or consent, such as information on surfing habits. 
        This is the most common reason for people rejecting or fearing cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies and the law</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">
        Most modern websites use cookies in some way, and it is unlikely that the majority of internet users even notice cookies 
        working away in the background as they browse from site to site. Until now it has been up to individual users to either 
        block or allow cookies using settings in their internet browser. From the end of May 2012 though, a new EU law will require 
        all sites that use cookies to seek your express permission to store and retrieve data about your browsing habits.
        <br>
        Most sites will now draw your attention to their cookie policy when you first visit the home page. 
        Don't be put off by this, you were probably sharing details with the site before without even knowing it. 
        In many cases you can click to say you understand the cookies policy but in many instance you can simply ignore 
        the announcement and continue browsing as normal.
        <br>
        Sites will continue to use cookies and the information they store in order to make your online browsing an easier, 
        more enjoyable experience. Cookies are nothing to be scared of, even if the new prompts seeking your consent might seem 
        a little off-putting for the cautious internet user.
        <br>
    In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) will be closely monitoring sites to make sure that they comply 
    with this new legislation, so there will be no avoiding the regulations. Websites have had over a year to make the changes 
    to their code, so there should be no excuses!
        </p>
