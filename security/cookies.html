        <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">A cookie is a piece of information in the form of a very small text file that is placed on an internet user's hard
            drive. It is generated by a web page server, which is basically the computer that operates a web site. The information
            the cookie contains is set by the server and it can be used by that server whenever the user visits the site.
            A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which tell a web site when the user has
            returned, they can be used to store all sorts of information, like preferences, browser type, location, etc.
            and this information can be used to better users experience Typically, they contain two pieces of information:
            a site name and unique user ID.</p>
        <img src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/web-cookies-diagram.jpg?x92042">
        <p class="textBody"> To be technical, the browser is the program that mediates cookie control between the computer and the website. These
            cookies used by a website to present different types of content depending on who is visiting that website. Cookies
            can expire after a given time period (usually determined by the website issuing the cookie), but if necessary,
            they can be manually deleted.</p>
        <h3>What does a cookie look like?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody"> Below is the content of a typical cookie. This one is from the Hotmail service and has the filename jss@hotmail.msn.txt
            (.txt is the standard filename extension for text files):</p>
        <p class="quote"> HMP1 1 hotmail.msn.com/ 0 1715191808 32107852 1236821008 29449527 * </p>
        <p class="textBody"> The codes will only make sense to Microsoft's MSN Hotmail servers. </p>
        <h3>a bit of History </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Cookies for the internet were originally developed in 1995 by the Netscape Communications Corporation. The word 'cookie'
            comes from 'magic cookie,' a term in programming languages for a piece of information shared between co-operating
            pieces of software. The choice of the word cookie appears to come from the American tradition of giving and sharing
            edible cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>How do Cookies work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">When you visit a site that uses cookies for the first time, a cookie is downloaded onto your PC. The next time you
            visit that site, your PC checks to see if it has a cookie that is relevant (that is, one containing the site
            name) and sends the information contained in that cookie back to the site. The site then ‚Äôknows‚Äô that you have
            been there before, and in some cases, tailors what pops up on screen to take account of that fact. For instance,
            it can be helpful to vary content according to whether this is your first ever visit to a site ‚Äì or your 71st.
            <br> Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be
            very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping cart or to remember the user's preferences
            or registration details for a future visit. Web sites use cookies mainly because they save time and make the
            browsing experience more efficient and enjoyable. Web sites often use cookies for the purposes of collecting
            demographic information about their users. Cookies enable web sites to monitor their users' web surfing habits
            and profile them for marketing purposes (for example, to find out which products or services they are interested
            in and send them targeted advertisements).
        </p>
        <h3>Are there different types of cookies?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="textBody">
        Cookies come in different flavours:

        Session, or transient cookies

Cookies that are stored in the computer's memory only during a user's browsing session and are automatically deleted from the user's computer when the browser is closed.

These cookies usually store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly. They are widely used by commercial web sites (for example, to keep track of items that a consumer has added to a shopping cart).

Cartoon Banking Cookie
Session cookies are never written on the hard drive and they do not collect any information from the user's computer. Session cookies expire at the end of the user's browser session and can also become no longer accessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 minutes.

Permanent, persistent, or stored cookies

Cookies that are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Permanent cookies can retain user preferences for a particular web site, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.

Permanent cookies can be used to identify individual users, so they may be used by web sites to analyse users' surfing behaviour within the web site. These cookies can also be used to provide information about numbers of visitors, the average time spent on a particular page and generally the performance of the web site. They are usually configured to keep track of users for a prolonged period of time, in some cases many years into the future.

Flash cookies

If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do), small files may be stored on your computer by websites that contain Flash media, such as video clips. These files are known as Local Shared Objects (LSOs) or Flash cookies. They can be used for the same purposes as regular cookies (properly called HTTP cookies).

Flash cookies can also back up the data that is stored in a regular cookie. When you delete cookies using your browser controls, your Flash cookies are not affected. So a website that served a cookie to you may recognise you on your next visit if it backed up its now-deleted cookie data to a Flash cookie.

You can control Flash cookies. Adobe's website offers tools to control Flash cookies on your computer and users of the Firefox browser can also get an add-on to detect and delete Flash cookies.
